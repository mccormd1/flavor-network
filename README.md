Levenshtein Distance recipes recommender

This is a project where I attempt to make a ingredient recommender system for determining the distance (in ingredients) between a specific recipe and the cuisine of a different region/culture.

Currently everything is held in the .ipynb, as I have put this together quickly, but it will be more organized as I have some time to work on it.
